      <a class="mausoleum" href="https://www.britannica.com/art/Mughal-architecture" target="_blank">
        <span class="mausoleum1">Mughal architecture</span> </a>. It was built by Emperor 
      <a class="mausoleum" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shah-Jahan" target="_blank">
        <span class="mausoleum1">Shah Jahān</span> </a> (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of
      the
      Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took
      about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which
      includes an immense garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made
      of white marble that features semiprecious stones in geometric and
      floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four smaller
      domes. According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own
      mausoleum made out of black marble.
