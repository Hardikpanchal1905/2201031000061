      Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest
      building-construction projects, the

        <span class="great-wall-of1">Great Wall of China</span> </a> is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850
      km) long; a disputed
      Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km).
      Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia.
      Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel
      walls for lengthy stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot
      the bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its
      effectiveness. Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids, the
      wall largely failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have
      noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”
