        <span class="petra3">Jordan</span> </a>, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and

        <span class="petra3">Nabataeans</span> </a>, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time it
      flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for spices.
      Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs
      into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In
      addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for lush gardens
      and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000.
      The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted.
